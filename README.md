# Individual Research Project - Autonomous Vehicle Dynamics and Control

Welcome to my Individual Research Project (IRP), a collaboration between Cranfield University and Thales, conducted as part of my studies in Autonomous Vehicle Dynamics and Control.

## Main Aim:

This project, proposed by Thales, aims to develop a system that integrates real-time flight data and dynamic parameters to intelligently manage and optimize communication resources. The system ensures efficient and secure communication between aircraft during different phases of flight.

The simulation for this project was developed using Unity. While the code is not available here, I would be happy to share it upon request!
